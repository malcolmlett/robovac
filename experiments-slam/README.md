# SLAM Experiments
This folder contains the original experiments that I went through during development of the SLAM model.

The notebooks here are usually locked to a particular repo revision when they do their checkout at the start.
This enables me to make changes to the code without wasting time refactoring the old notebooks, and also allows
me to avoid the mess of supporting old experiments that I've since discarded.
